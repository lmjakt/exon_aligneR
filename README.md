# exon_aligneR

Given the exon sequences of two candidate orthologues create an alignment of
the genes as a set of exons in order to identify orthologous exons. The
algorithm considers exons as residues to be aligned using a modified
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

The alignments will be implemented in C.
